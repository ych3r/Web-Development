# HTML

HTML is the **skeleton** of a web page. So when you want to build a fancy website, you should start with the HTML. (We currently are using HTML5)

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>your website's title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>big size font here</h1>
    <p>paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

You could save the **.html** file and open it in browser. You could start a server maybe apache2 and place the file in **/var/www/html/**(probably). Then all the devices in your LAN could see your web page.
Same as the other website, except their files are located in public server.

People create content in *\<body\>* part. *\<head\>* is used for other things like the title shows on browser's titlebar and link to CSS file or other resources etc. Rest of that are just format.

## In the \<body\> part

use \<div\> to divide things.
