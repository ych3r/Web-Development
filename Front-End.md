## HTML
**HTML** is the skeleton of the web page.
Check on somebody's website and right-click to see it's source code. You'll find similar structure on every webpage.

## CSS
**CSS** is magic.
It makes your html page looks awesome. But it's hard to remember every function.

## Bootstrap
**Bootstrap** is a CSS library which makes CSS way much easier. I don't think developers nowadays start building web page from plain text. This powerful library helps a lot. However, you still need to understand HTML and CSS in order to fix the code to what you want.

## JavaScript
**JavaScript** gives your website functions. Before JS, your website is just a static page which means people can't interact with it.
**DOM - Document Object Model** is the structure of the website(like a tree). You could use JS to manipulate DOM.

## jQuery
**jQuery** is one of JS's libraries. It simplifies the code.
